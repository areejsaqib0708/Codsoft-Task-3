# Codsoft-Task-3
This Python code showcases a password generator graphical user interface (GUI) built using the tkinter library. The main window features various components for generating and copying passwords of different strengths and lengths. The code's functionality is divided into several key sections:

•Main Window and Layout:
The program initializes a GUI window with a title and dimensions. The layout is designed with a clean and user-friendly interface, including labels, spinboxes, combobox, buttons, and an entry field.

•Password Generation:
The code defines a generator() function responsible for creating passwords based on user preferences. It determines the password length specified in the spinbox and the selected strength level from the combobox. Depending on the strength level, the generator constructs the character pool using lowercase and uppercase alphabets, numbers, and special characters. It then generates a password using random selections from the character pool and displays it in the password entry field.

•Password Copying:
The Copy() function allows users to copy the generated password to their clipboard using the pyperclip library. Clicking the "Copy" button triggers this function, making it convenient for users to paste the generated password elsewhere.

•GUI Components:
Labels are used to display titles for the password generator and strength settings. Spinbox and combobox widgets provide options for selecting password length and strength level, respectively. Buttons for generating passwords and copying them, along with an entry field to display the generated password, complete the interface.

•Overall:
This code offers an interactive solution for generating secure passwords of different complexities. Users can customize the length and strength of passwords based on their requirements, and with the click of a button, they can generate and copy passwords for various applications. The clean design and easy-to-use functionalities make this password generator a practical tool for enhancing online security.
